# PSA_framework

The PSA framework is a protein structural analysis pipeline that makes use of NextFlow as its workflow manager. The tools incorporated into this pipeline includes the Rosetta Fixed Backbone design application, the Rosetta SimpleThreadingMover, Maestro - Multi Agent Stability Predition tool, and Gromacs. The Rosetta tools allow for, but not limited to, the implementation of a point mutation on the native structure (Rosetta FIxed Backbone), as well as the implementation of a point mutation on the amino acid sequence of the native protein which is then threaded into the native structure (Rosetta SimpleThreaderMover). The structures produced by the Rosetta processes are then passed to Gromacs, where a molecular dynamics simulation is executed, which helps asses how well the stability of the native structure is maintained with the applied mutation. This gives insight into the destabilising effect of the mutations. Maestro is used to provide a ddG value which allows us to see the destabilising or stabilising effect of the mutation.
