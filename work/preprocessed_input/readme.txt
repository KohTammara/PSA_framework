The pdb files used in this pipeline should be preprocessed according to the forcefield used.

In the case of this sudy, the charmm36m all atom force field was used and preprocessed using CHARMM-GUI for use in pmx and gromacs.

Mutation on input data are implemented within the computational framework and are not implemented with CHARMM-GUI.
